# Complex Systems 270 Final Project
By: Matthew Drutis, Logan Hayner, Stevie Port

## Multi-lane Highway Simulation 🛣️:

There are 3 different agents that can spawn, each with their own individual driving characteristics.
- **Reckless** 🏎️
- **Cautious** 👵
- **Normal** 🚙

> We hope you test this simulation for yourself with different parameters, and adjust your real-life driving patterns accordingly.
## To run the simulation yourself:
### Clone the repository:
With SSH:
`git clone git@github.com:madrutis/cmplxsys_finalproj.git`
With HTTPS:
`git clone https://github.com/madrutis/cmplxsys_finalproj.git`

### Getting Started
Run the script `setup.sh` in your preferred unix/linux terminal which will:
- make a new virtual environment
- download the requirements

### Running the simulation:
Take a look around simulation.py, and adjust the initial parameters to the `Simulation` class.
In VS Code or your preferred IDE, right click on the code in simulation.py, and click "Run in Interactive Terminal"
Voila :magic_wand
