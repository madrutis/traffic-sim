# Complex Systems 270 Final Project
By: Matthew Drutis, Logan Hayner, Stevie Port

## Multi-lane Highway Simulation 🛣️:

There are 3 different agents that can spawn, each with their own individual driving characteristics.
- Reckless 🏎️
- Cautious 👵
- Normal 🚙

We hope you test this simulation for yourself with different parameters, and adjust your real-life driving patterns accordingly.
