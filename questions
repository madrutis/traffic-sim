Questions for the professor:

1. I modified a couple of things within the code in the dynamics to make things run a 
bit smoother is this okay? (in terms of lane changing)
2. The simulation often depends on the distribution of driving techniques... not sure how to fix this.
3. Any suggestions to make this more realistic?
